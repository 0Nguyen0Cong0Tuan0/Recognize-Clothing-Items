# **Recognize Clothing Items**
The Clothing Item Recognition project focuses on the field of **AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning**, specifically in the domain of **Computer Vision**. This project involves building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier** to identify fashion items from the widely-used Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of clothing and accessories across ten categories, such as shirts, shoes, and bags.

Developed in **Python** using the **TensorFlow** module, the project emphasizes key aspects of machine learning, including model architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. It serves as an engaging introduction to neural networks while demonstrating practical applications of AI in recognizing and categorizing fashion items, showcasing its potential for solving real-world problems in industries like retail and e-commerce.

## Features
- Uses a neural network to classify clothing items.
- Input images are 28x28 grayscale pixels.
- Implements a simple architecture with dense layers.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

## Model Architecture
- **Input Layer**: 28x28 pixel flattened input.
- **Hidden Layer**: 128 neurons with ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer**: 10 classes with softmax activation.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which consists of 10 categories of clothing items.
